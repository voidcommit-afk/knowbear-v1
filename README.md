# KnowBear

KnowBear is a personal full-stack AI explanation workspace focused on clean architecture, resilient streaming UX, and reliable runtime behavior.

## Project Highlights

This project is intentionally built with production-style concerns:

- Frontend with strong state/data boundaries (`zustand` + `zod`)
- Backend with FastAPI, structured logging, middleware, and consistent error contracts
- Streaming generation pipeline with fallback behavior
- Redis-backed caching and token rate limiting with in-memory fallback
- Dockerized local setup and one-command local startup

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind, Zustand, Zod
- Backend: FastAPI, Pydantic, Uvicorn
- AI layer: Groq + Gemini via provider abstraction
- Web search & Retrieval: Tavily / Serper / Exa integration hooks
- Caching & limits: Upstash Redis (optional), in-memory fallback

## API Surface

- `GET /api/pinned` - curated starter topics
- `POST /api/query` - generate one or more explanation levels
- `POST /api/query/stream` - stream explanations over SSE
- `GET /api/health` - service health metadata
- `GET /api/keep-alive` - lightweight warmup probe (includes Upstash ping/get if configured)

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Python 3.10+

### One Command (recommended)

```bash
npm run local:start
```

What it does:
1. Installs frontend dependencies (`npm install`)
2. Installs backend dependencies (`python -m pip install -r api/requirements.txt`)
3. Starts frontend on `http://localhost:5173`
4. Starts backend on `http://localhost:8000`

## Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Services/ports:
- Frontend: `5173`
- Backend: `8000`

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file (or set environment variables directly).

Commonly used:

- `VITE_API_URL` (example: `http://localhost:8000`)
- `GROQ_API_KEY`
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` (optional fallback/judge path)
- `TAVILY_API_KEY` / `SERPER_API_KEY` / `EXA_API_KEY` (optional retrieval providers)
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` / `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` (optional distributed cache/limits)

## Engineering Highlights

- Runtime validation with Zod at frontend API boundaries to prevent invalid payload propagation.
- Centralized Zustand store with persisted user preferences and non-persisted transient runtime state.
- Streaming resilience with fallback to non-stream response path when SSE conditions are degraded.
- Regenerate path bypasses cache and forwards temperature, enabling controlled response variation.

## Validation Commands

```bash
npm run type-check
npm run test -- --run
python -m compileall -q api
```

## Repository Structure

```text
src/                 # React frontend
api/                 # FastAPI backend
Dockerfile
docker-compose.yml
```

## Note

KnowBear is a personal project that evolved into a focused, depth-first explanation system with practical reliability features across frontend and backend.

## Development Journey

KnowBear began as a lean web application built around single query-response interactions: fast, stateless, and minimal by design. That core philosophy remains intact.

It later expanded into a more ambitious chat platform with three dedicated workspace modes, built for multi-turn conversations and collaborative workflows. The experiment was valuable, but it also made the product heavier and less focused than intended.

The project was then reoriented toward a clearer objective: a depth-first, explanation-driven system powered by RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). That iteration remains a work in progress.

The current version reflects the lessons from each phase. It is a streamlined, production-ready API focused on delivering deeper answers with relevant live retrieval context, while preserving the speed, simplicity, and low-latency experience that made the original concept effective.
