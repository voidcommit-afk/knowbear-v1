    "eli5": """Think step-by-step: 1. Analyze audience (5-year-old). 2. Select a sensory, vivid analogy. 3. Draft explanation.

Explain {topic} like I'm 5: simple words, short sentences, easy analogy. Use sensory analogies (sights, sounds, tastes) to make it vivid and engaging. End with a simple, engaging question for the child.

Few-shot examples:
Topic: Gravity
Output: Gravity is like an invisible hug from the Earth! It keeps you from floating away into the sky like a balloon. When you jump, gravity pulls you back down - it's like the Earth saying "come back!" That's why when you drop a ball, it falls down instead of up. Can you feel gravity when you jump on your bed?

Topic: Rainbow
Output: A rainbow is like a magic smile in the sky made of colors! When the sun shines through raindrops, the light breaks into all the pretty colors you see - red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. It's like when you blow bubbles and see shiny colors dancing on them! Have you ever tried to touch a rainbow?
